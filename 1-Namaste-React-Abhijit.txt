Episode 1 :
VS Code is used EMMET - What is this is generate some code for you in VS code 
If we write html:5 it generate the basic html for you 

1. We see how we can create the basic hello world program using the html (created index.html file and in h1 tag added the text)
2. Here we see how we can create the basic hello world program using the Javascript  (Checkout the solution in the index.html file)
3. Now how we can create the basic hello world program using the React 
4. To inject the react into our project we use the CDN react (CDN - Content delivery network)
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script> -> this will inject the react 
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script> ->this will inject the reactDom we use to modify the DOM

After including this script tag then we have react inside our project now the browser will understand what is react.
-Now we have injected the react if we go to the browser and inspect it and type the react we will see the lots of things we get. (children, component, etc)
-If we write the ReactDOM in console you will see the different functions give by the react DOM.
-console.warn("This heading is a react element and we can see in the console the react element will be printed",heading) 
-if we print the heading we can see the react element and it has he props the props means 
{
    "id": "xyz",
    "children": "Hello World form React!"
}
this that we have passed as a parameter there
const heading = React.createElement("h1", {id:"xyz"}, "Hello World form React!");


EX:The below structure we have created using the react 
<div id = "parent">
       <div id = "child">
           <h1>I'm H1 Tag means heading tag</h1>
        </div>
 </div>

 const parentElement = React.createElement(
  "div",
  { id: "parent" },
  React.createElement(
    "div",
    { id: "child" },
    React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am an h1 tag")
  )
);
This is the structure 

- And the ReactElement is basically is a object ReactElement(Object) = HTML (Browser understand)
- The react element become the HTML that browser understand while rendering into the DOM it converts the react code into the DOM (EX: root.render(parentElement);)

-const parentElement = React.createElement(
  "div",
  { id: "parent" },
  React.createElement(
    "div",
    { id: "child" },
    [
      React.createElement("h1", {}, "I am an h1 tag"),
      React.createElement("h2", {}, "I am an h2 tag"),
    ] // if we want to add one more sibling to it then we need to add that in the array
  )
); 
To avoid this complex structure we have JSX
- JSX will make our life easy when we have to create the tagsÂ±


Episode 2:
-npm npm basically a package manager where all the package are there
-Now to initialize the npm in our app then we need to do the (npm init)
-It will generate the package.json file this is the basically a configuration for npm
-Why we need this package.json the package we install is also knows as the dependencies npm manage that and it will manage that in the package.json file
-npm install -D parcel we have install the parcel to bundle the packages as we can see the -D we have use there its a dev dependencies means it is required in the development env 
-When we install the parcel then we will see the new files are added package-lock.json file and node_modules
-What is difference between package.json and package-lock.json file package.json keeps track of version of packages that we install and package-lock.json keep track of exact version that is we install its will lock the exact version of the package that we install 
-If we have package.json and package-lock.json then we can regenerate the node modules that is why we don't need to push the node_modules to the git 
-We can recreate the node_modules using the command (npm install)
-"parcel": "^2.12.0" as you can see the ^ this sign it will get the minor update and if we see Â§ tild sign then it will take the major update
-(npx parcel index.html) we ignite our app using this command.
-What is npx just like npm we have npx. npx means executing our package whenever we have to execute our package we use the npx <package name>
-After igniting the app the lots of things are happened
-To inject the react into our app we use the CDN links there is another way to inject the react into our app is using npm using node package manager
-The CDN links are not good way to initialize the react app.
-Now to install the react into our app we have to use the command (npm install react) and we need to install the react DOM also (npm install react-dom)
-If we check the package.json we will see the react and react-dom is installed properly 
"dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1"
  }
-Now we are getting an error its not able to find out from where the react is coming for because previosuly we use the CDN links now we are installing the packages 
-So we need to import the react 
-import React from "react"; we import the react so form where it is coming from its coming form node_module from react file so thats the meaning of import 
-If we change something in code we will see that change in browser automatically we dont need to reload the page this happend because we use the parcel in our app

# Parcel
-Dev Build
-Local Server
-HMR = Hot Module Replacement
-It Uses file watching algorithm - its written in C++
-Caching = Faster Build 
-Image Optimization
-Minification 
-Bundling
-Compressing
-Consistent Hashing
-Code Splitting
-Differential Bundling - supports older browsers
-Diagnostic 
-Error Handling 
-Https
-Tree Shaking - remove unused code
-Different dev and prod bundles

-If we want to do the prod build then we need to use the command like (npx parcel build index.html)
As we hit this command then we get the error
ðŸš¨ Build failed.

@parcel/namer-default: Target "main" declares an output file path of "app.js" which 
does not match the compiled bundle type "html".

  /Users/abhijit/Desktop/Namaste-React/package.json:5:11
    4 |   "description": "This is Namaste-React Abhijit",
  > 5 |   "main": "app.js",
  >   |           ^^^^^^^^ Did you mean "app.html"?
    6 |   "scripts": {
    7 |     "test": "Jest"

  ðŸ’¡ Try changing the file extension of "main" in package.json.

-so to resolve this error we need to remove the "main": "app.js", this from the package.json because its not the entry point of our application we have write there in cmd as index.html its not matching there 
npx parcel build index.html
âœ¨ Built in 839ms
dist/index.html                345 B    310ms
dist/index.d8c12c77.css         85 B     31ms
dist/index.268a7a54.js     139.24 KB    179ms

-It will build the all dist file in the dist we will see it will compresseed everything and now our code is production ready it will minify our code  
-We have browser list where we can add for which browser our app will support

Episode 3:
we can create a script to build our production ready app then we need to write the script there in the package.json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "test": "Jest"
  }
  This script is used to create a dev build 
  -Lets create a script for building a production
   "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html"
    "test": "Jest"
  }
  -this script is used to build the production app
  -Now we have created the script now we don't need to write the (npx parcel index.html) to build our app.
  -Suppose if we got to the company and you don't know how to build the application then go to the package.json file and you will find the scripts there and you will see the command to run the code
  -Now to run the application so what command we need to hit 
   "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html"
    "test": "Jest"
  }
-To run the application we need to use the command (npm run start) and if you hit the enter it will do the same things that our run cmd do 
npm run start
> namaste-react@1.0.0 start
> parcel index.html
Server running at http://localhost:1234
âœ¨ Built in 514ms

-As you can see our application is running we just need so see the package.json and look for the script and check what is written in the start section and hit (npm run <script>) your application will run successfully.
or you can do the (npm start) also it will start the application it will same as the (npm run start)
-I have created the new app1.js file 
-JSX React = const jsxHeading = <h1 id="tag">This is h1 tag using JSX ðŸš€</h1>; // This is not HTML this is JSX. JSX is different than HTML its HTML like syntax
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root2"))
root.render(jsxHeading)
-As you can see the h1 tag we have written that is JSX
-JSX React (transpiled before it reaches the JS engine) - this is done by parcel - parcel will do this work form the babel as we save the code babel will convert the code into the react code (react understandable code).
-JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement.JS Object => HTMLElement(render)
-This is how the code will work in background
-If we want to give the class name in the JSX the we need to give like this => className="head"
-If we want to write the multiple lines the babel code then we need to write it into the () parenthesis
EX: const jsxHeading = (
  <h1 className="head" id="tag">
    This is h1 tag using JSX ðŸš€
  </h1>
); 
-React components = are the building blocks of the react application.
-There are two types of components in react 
1.Class Based Components - Old way of writing react components
2.Functional Components - New way of writing react components

-React Functional Components
EX:
//Functional components
const FunctionalComponent = () => {
    return <h1>Namaste Guys React Functional Component</h1>
};
-This is the react functional component with return the JSX code
-We will use the functional component all across the places
-To render the functional component we need to use the 
root.render(<FunctionalComponent/>); method
-<FunctionalComponent/> like this we need to add to render the functional component
-How we can write the JavaScript code inside the Function component
EX:const FunctionalComponent = () => (
    <div id="container">
        <h2>{100 + 200}</h2> // Using the {} these curly braces we can write the javascript code in the function component
        <h1>THIS IS FUNCETIONAL COMP</h1>
    <h1 className="functionComp">Namaste Guys React Functional Component</h1>
  </div>
);
-This is how we can write the Javascript in the functional component
-How we can render the component inside the component =>
EX:const Title = () => (
    <h2>This is how we can render the data in the functional comp using</h2>
);

const FunctionalComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
    <Title /> // Here we render the component inside the component
    <h2>{}</h2> // Using the {} these curly braces we can write the
    javascript code in the function component
    <h1>THIS IS FUNCETIONAL COMP</h1>
    <h1 className="functionComp">Namaste Guys React Functional Component</h1>
  </div>
);

-Lets see the example how we can render the text or something in the functional component with example 
-<> ... </> is a React Fragment. It allows you to group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM.
-If we are getting the data form the API like 
EX: const data = api.getData();
-Then we can use the {} these curly braces to render the data in the functional component
EX: const FunctionalComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
    <Title /> // Here we render the component inside the component
    <h2>{data}</h2> // Using the {} these curly braces we can write the
    javascript code in the function component
)
-If attacker get access to run some JavaScript code in your browser what we can do this type of attack is knows as cross-site scripting (XSS)
-But JSX is so amazing it wil take care of this type of attack it prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) for you
